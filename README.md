## Project Overview  
The **Distress Detection and GPS Alert System** is an AI-powered solution designed to enhance personal safety. It detects distress signals, such as screams, from audio inputs and automatically alerts trusted contacts or emergency services with the user's GPS location. This system aims to address personal safety challenges and ensure timely assistance in emergencies.  

---

## Features  
- **Real-Time Audio Analysis:** Detects distress signals (e.g., screams) using machine learning models.  
- **Dynamic GPS Retrieval:** Automatically fetches and logs GPS coordinates using geolocation APIs.  
- **SMS Alerts:** Sends SMS notifications with location details using Twilio's messaging service.  
- **Customizable:** Supports user-defined trusted contacts for personalized emergency responses.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python Libraries:**  
  - Machine Learning: `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`  
  - Audio Processing: `Librosa`  
  - Geolocation: `geopy`  
  - SMS Service: `Twilio` API  
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)  
- **APIs:** Twilio Messaging API, Nominatim Geolocation API

## Installation  
Follow these steps to set up the project:  

1. Clone this repository:  m/username/distress-detection-gps-alert.git
   Navigate to the project directory:


cd distress-detection-gps-alert  
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt  
Configure the Twilio API credentials in the config.py file:

TWILIO_SID = "your_twilio_sid"  
TWILIO_TOKEN = "your_twilio_token"  
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER = "your_twilio_phone_number"  
TWILIO_TO_NUMBER = "trusted_contact_number"  
Usage
Prepare the Audio File:
Place the audio file you want to analyze in the project directory.

Run the Main Pipeline:
Execute the script to analyze the audio and send alerts if necessary:

python main.py --audio_path test_audio.wav  
Receive Alerts:
If a scream is detected, the system will send an SMS to the configured trusted contact with the GPS coordinates.

Future Improvements
Enhance the model's ability to detect various distress signals beyond screams.
Integrate additional alert methods such as email or push notifications.
Implement a mobile app interface for ease of use and better accessibility.
Improve the GPS retrieval mechanism to support offline environments.
Add multi-language support for alerts.
